			</div>
			<br>
			The <strong>first of 3 games</strong> consists of 4 items: record crates, antique lamps, Art Deco paintings, and cuckoo clocks. <br>
			<strong>Later games may have different items, and they may be worth more or less!  Pay close attention.</strong>
			<br>
			<div id="ava2">
			In the first game, your agent gets <strong>4 points for each box of records, 3 points for each of the paintings, 2 points for each of the lamps, and only 1 point for each cuckoo clock</strong>.  <br>
			This means that the records are worth the most to it!  Your opponent may want the same items, <strong>or they may not</strong>.<br>

			Below is a picture of the game board. The chat log is on the right, and a picture of your partner on the left. In the bottom half, there is a trade table and buttons.  Near your partner's picture, you may see tips appear to help guide you!
			<br>
			<div id="pva3">
			In the game, you can send messages and questions to your opponent. You can also move items around on the game board, and send offers. <br>

		<h1>About the Trade Table:</h1> <br>
		<div id="ava4">
		Below is the trade table. With the trade table <strong>your agent can send offers to your partner</strong>.  You cannot interact with this interface and must watch your agent do so for you.
		    Your agent can click any item to pick it up, then click again to place it.
			For example, it can click one of the lamps in the middle and then click it to your side.  It can click multiple times for more items.  Nothing sends until it clicks "Send Offer".<br><br>
			It can also accept or reject <strong>PARTIAL</strong> offers that your partner sends it. <strong>These offers aren't binding, but are helpful in building towards a full offer</strong>.<br>
			Pressing "Formal Accept" is only possible if ALL items are either on its side or your partner's.  If they both agree, the game is finished!  <br><br>

		Clicking either of the first two buttons on the right side will let you <strong>express your preferences for items</strong>. Just click the item you want to talk about once,
		then click again in one of the boxes.  
		<br>
		Here, you can see that you're about to say that you like "lamps" "less than" "paintings".  You can also click the "less than" symbol to turn it into different
